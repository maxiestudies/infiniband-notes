* Service Types
** Connected services
   Need connection establishment
   QPs are initialized with information about each other and stored in the QPs context
   Are private, point-to-point communication channels
   The two QPs can then only send messages to each other
*** REliable Connected (RC):
    The responder QL's RQ logic must respond to each request packet with a n ACK or Nak packet
*** Unreliable Connected (UC):
    Same as RC but the responder does not send back a response to each request packet
** Datagram services
   can transfer messages to different QPs
*** Reliable datagram (RD):
    requires a connection establishment between two CAs (and not QPs)
    EEC contains send and receive logic but not SQ or RQ. It "represents" it's local SQ and RQ in RD mode
    has an Ack/Nack protocol
*** Unreliable datagram (UD):
    doesn't require connection
    QP attached to a port
    Destination specified in WR
    no Ack/Nack
    no PSN checking
    used for MADS
** Non-IBA services
*** Raw IPV6 Datagram
*** Raw EtherType Datagram
* IBA Stack for message transmission and reception
** Upper layer protocols
   not a part of the IB implementation. Software application or driver that uses infiniband
** Verb layer
   software calls the verbs to do:
   - HCA management
   - QP management
   - EEC managment
   - post work requests
   - handle message transfer completions
** Transport layer
   responsible for sending and receiving messages across the fabric
** Network layer
   responsible for routing
** Link layer
   responsible for sending and receiving data across the fabric, including addressing, buffering, error control and packet switching
** Physical layer
   responsible for sending data across the fabric at the bit-level
